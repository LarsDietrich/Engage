INITIAL USE: 
Staff retreat, no internet access, Engage served up from a laptop on a wireless network... all staff had laptops. The goal was to have a way for a presenter/moderator to pose discussion questions and/or polls on screen to a known/trusted audience w/ laptops. The presenter could then guide discussion based on the live feedback. There was no need for authentication/authorization. Every comment submitted was entered into the database and added to the stream of comments visible to the attendees.


WHAT WORKS NOW:
- Create Topic (messages/comments are associated with a topic)
- Create Poll (answers can be custom strings, but limited to 3, and not multiple choice)


FUTURE: 
- Convert from straight CSS to LESS.js?
- There should probably be some authentication/authorization added down the road so that Topic and Poll creation can be restricted to a moderator or assistant.
- Threaded comments / replies in the stream
- Allow flexible number of poll answers
- Allow multiple choice for poll answers
- Mobile-friendly interface (target full compat. w/ Android and iOS devices)
